#testing. I waanted to build an affiliate website so I planned on testing with a Bitcoin donation link. If that worked I was then 
#going to continue the build. But Now i am finding a much easier way with a few compnies that specialise in affiliate marketing. So I can
# Build my sites of interest and knowledge easy as f*ck :) And market them massivley and hopefully make some coin. Fingers crossed.
#There is a lot of content from Github and many marketing site here, I can still use Guthub & GH is pretty massive now so its good to keep
#up with.
